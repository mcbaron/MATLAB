KT
-----
A Knight’s Tour script, given an arbitrarily large chess board, we attempt to find an open knight’s tour, which can then be visualized using boardprint.m. This was written for a summer class I took after my freshman year of college.

-----
Just a quick and dirty thing to visualize the difference between envelope detection via AM demod and the Hilbert Transform.
